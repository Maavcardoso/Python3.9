# Python3.9
Hi there! I'm learning coding with Python 3 and i will store all my lessons and challenges in this repository. 
Feel free to use my codes and/or change anything you want.
I usually write a lot of notes about python basics and logical paths , but it's only available in Portuguese for now.

Olá! Estou aprendendo Phyton 3 e colocarei todas as aulas e desafios neste repositório.
Fique a vontade para usar meus códigos e/ou alterar o que quiser.
Escrevo diversos comentários, principalmente com fundamentos de Python e resoluções de exercícios.

**Special Thanks**

For Gustavo Guanabara, thanks for him i'm learning python with a high quality class for free.

For Python Brasil's community, their wiki is extremely helpful and the exercises are challenging.
